I've found some good resources documenting some design decisions that both I and others have made

## Some basic design decisions I'm making:

* I want to use larger flanged bearings as indlers instead of the toothed idlers. Mostly because I trust the robustness of larger bearings, over the tiny cheap ones in the toothed idlers.
* I am choosing not to twist the belts in order to run them against all flats, but this decision might change. 
* The Vez3D printer has a 4WD variant that uses 4 motors for the core-xy belt system. It's honestly overkill, but I think it will really help with belt tension and acurracy, and will hopefully increase accels
* Downside is now I have only 1 z motor, so I won't have auto bed alignment and I'll have to do this manually (honestly with lower flatness I need to do this anyway
* I'm toying with ways to make the frame as stiff and square as possible. The biggest decision here is ordering specific lengths of aluminum extrusion as I don't have access to a mill. I also am overlapping the top/bottom squares so I can assemble them off the printer and bolt them on later
